Project Title: Web Scraping Nigerian Universities Data from Wikipedia

Description:

This project involves the use of Python for web scraping to extract and gather comprehensive data on universities in Nigeria from a Wikipedia page. The primary objective is to compile a dataset containing essential information about these institutions, such as their names, locations, establishment dates, and any additional relevant details.

Key Steps:

Data Source: The data source for this project is a specific Wikipedia page titled "List of Universities in Nigeria."

Web Scraping: Python libraries, particularly requests and BeautifulSoup, are employed for web scraping. The code interacts with the Wikipedia page, retrieves the HTML content, and parses it to locate the target information.

Data Extraction: The project involves locating the relevant table(s) on the Wikipedia page and extracting data from the tables, taking care to handle variations and unexpected data structures.

Data Structuring: Extracted data is organized into a structured format, typically as a dataset or data frame. Each row represents a university, with columns representing various attributes such as name, location, establishment year, and more.

Data Validation: Quality control measures are implemented to validate the accuracy and completeness of the scraped data.

Data Storage: The final dataset may be stored in a suitable format for further analysis or integration into other projects.

Project Benefits:

Comprehensive Dataset: The project yields a valuable dataset that can serve as a foundation for research, analysis, and decision-making related to higher education in Nigeria.

Automation: Automation through web scraping reduces manual effort and ensures that the dataset remains up-to-date as Wikipedia pages are updated.

Data Analysis: The collected data can be used for various analytical purposes, such as ranking universities, exploring geographic distribution, or identifying trends over time.
